The State of Reproducibility in Computer Science
------------------------------------------------

Introduction
 This archive contains all the data that we collected for our
 study of reproducibility except for emails. It also contains
 scripts for analyzing the data, as well as many that we used
 in managing and creating the database.

 Papers are organized by conference. With a sub directory for
 each paper. A data.txt file contains all the information we
 collected, details below.

Directories
 docs/tr        - Scripts used to generate tables and 
                  graphics for the paper - See below
 Java_Workspace - Code for data entry gui and email script 
                  generator
 ReproEditor    - Jar of data entry gui
 external       - Third party jar for parsing pdfs
 removed_papers - See removed_papers/deleted_papers.txt for
                  why these were removed
 scripts        - Various scripts - See below
 webpage        - An internally used webpage for viewing pie
                  charts.

Scripts
 Details on each script can be found in the readme in that
 directory. The main script for creating statistics on the
 database is repro_status.py. Run the help for that script
 for details.

Docs/tr
 Directory for the technical report. Finished report can
 be downloaded from the website.

 To use the scripts in this directory you will first need
 to generate macros using repro_status.py. From there,
 the next step is to prepare the data for sankey.py.
 Use these commands:
>echo "data = {}" > resultmacros.py
>grep DATA data/resultmacros.tex | sed -f makedata.sed >> resultmacros.py
 To make the table used in the paper:
>gawk -f maketable.awk < /dev/null > overviewtable.tex
