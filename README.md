# -NLP-Reproducibility-of-a-research

### The project aim is to classify the research papers as repeatable or reproducible based on various Natural Language Processing Techniques.

Parameters on which our model will be based:

` The comprehensibility of a paragraph.
` Length of a sentence. Too long of a sentence are not quite understandable.
- By analysing the citation graph:
  -    No. of times has that paper been cited?
  -    Whether any links to the source code has been provided?
  -    How strong that citation was? (Strong as in, how relatable was the topic of that paper was to it?) → Incoming links
  -    The kind of papers it has cited → outgoing links. How relatable were those citations were to the topic of the paper in concern?
  -    How strongly and seriously has it been cited as a reference within a text of other papers (incoming links)? Like for example: When they refer this paper in between the lines (“This paper [1] [2] [3] proposed that…..”) has it been referred in a group of many others or has it been referred as a specific one?
  -    Does that paper mentions any of the results or statistics it carried out? Because if a paper presents a statistical demo, there are higher chances of it having a working code developed by the authors to prepare that analysis.
